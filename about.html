            <h1>Hi there! My name is Kat, and welcome to my learning journal!</h1>
            <p>After years of serving tables I decided I needed a drastic career change. I've always been interested in computer science but school has never been my stongsuit so I decided to give Scrimba  try.</p>
            <h2>How I stay commited to learning</h2>
            <p>I like to think of myself as a good independant learner. sitting in a classroom behind a desk has never done for me what it needed to. with scrimba it's completely different. Wheather I'm at a coffee shop, at home, or on my break at work, i have toe freedom to learn anytime anywhere and go as fast or slow as I need. This flexibility allows me to stay commited to my learning without feeling overwhelmed or butnt out.</p>
            <h2>How I got started</h2>
            <p>I didn't start out exactly how other people may have. My older cousin actually has been doing this for much longer than I have and he has been pushing me for years to study coding and become a developer just like him. In 2024 after a bad breakup I decided I needed something new in my life and I was tired of serving tables and I needed a change, that's when my cousin told me about scrimba and told me to try the free trial. After completing it I was hooked and knew I could just spend hours learning how to code and the rest is history.</p>
